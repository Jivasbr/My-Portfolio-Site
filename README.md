# My Portfolio Website	
This is a Portfolio site under construction where I apply the new knowledge I'm acquiring, and in the future, I'll show projects from previous design experiences and future programming projects.

### Development progress:

1. 07/08/2022 - In this early version of the project, a basic homepage structure was created, a general design with 2 animated buttons for dark or light theme options and link buttons for LinkedIn, Github, and Behance. In the future, I will add some more visual details besides implementing the structure and content of the tabs about me, projects, and contact me.

   

2. 07/10/2022 - I decided to replace the dark/light mode buttons with a switch instead.

   

3. 07/20/2022 - Implemented a tab system with Javascript for content navigation.

   * Adjustments needed to optimize the buttons in the dark theme.

### Thanks to developers:

I couldn't create or even implement these features so quickly without the original creations.
