# My Portfolio Website	
This is a Portfolio site under construction where I apply the new knowledge I'm acquiring, and in the future, I'll show projects from previous design experiences and future programming projects.

### Development progress:

1. 07/08/2022

   * In this early version of the project, a basic homepage structure was created, a general design with 2 animated buttons for dark or light theme options and link buttons for LinkedIn, Github, and Behance. In the future, I will add some more visual details besides implementing the structure and content of the tabs about me, projects, and contact me.

   

2. 07/10/2022

   * I decided to replace the dark/light mode buttons with a switch instead.

   

3. 07/20/2022

   * Implemented a tab system with Javascript for content navigation.
   * Adjustments needed to optimize the buttons in the dark theme.

   

4. 07/26/2022 

   * Corrected and adjusted some links/buttons on the site in the light and dark versions.
   * Added typing animation with Javascript in the center rectangle of the homepage and added glitch effect to the name.
   * "About-me" section was created, where accordion menu and wrapper were inserted with a system to display and hide items for display according to the selected content.
   * Added stylized border to avatar icon 
   * Started the development of the contact tab where it will be necessary to correct the side menu because when the accordion is hidden in the "about me" tab and we go back to the contact tab, the menu disappears.

### Thanks to developers:

I couldn't create or even implement these features so quickly without the original creations.
